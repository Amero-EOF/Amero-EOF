### About me
Security, Programming, and teaching is my passion

Programming languages used: C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, TypeScript, and LUA/LUAU

I LOVE finding new challenges and I branch off into a ton of different subjects for fun.

Here are some programming subjects I've done:
Web Development
Game Development - Programming, Modelling
Compiler Development
Application Development

This is just the very tip of the iceberg of the things I've done, and I could go on for ages, but I'll spare you the details
